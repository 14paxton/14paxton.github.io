# Disable Unsecure Notification

> If you work with HTTPS connections on your localhost development environment, you will often get an un-secure notification from Chrome, and this
> will be getting annoying.

> To disable those notifications in Chrome type this in your address bar:

```
chrome://flags/
```

> search for:

- > ```Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost.```

> click on "Enable". Done!
