# Basic Docker Concepts and Terms    
    
## **Docker Image:**    
    
A lightweight, stand-alone, executable package **that** includes everything needed **to** run a piece **of** software.    
    
## **Docker Container:**    
    
A runtime instance of a Docker image.    
    
## **Docker Hub:**    
    
A cloud-based registry service where Docker users **and** partners create, test, store, **and** distribute container images.    
    
## **Dockerfile:**    
    
A text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line **to** assemble an image.    
    
## **Docker Compose:**    
    
A tool **for** defining **and** running multi-container Docker applications.    
    
## **Basic Docker Commands:**

Provides **the** ability to use digital signatures **for** data sent to **and** received from remote Docker registries.    
    
**15. Docker and CI/CD:**    
    
**● Docker in Jenkins:**

**● Docker on Google Cloud:**    
    
Google Cloud provides Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) **for** running Docker containers.    
    
**17. Docker Best Practices:**    
    
**● Container immutability:**    
    
The idea that you never update **a** running container, instead, you should always create **a** new one.    
    
**● Single process per container:**    
    
Each container should address a single concern **and do** it well.    
    
**● Minimize layer counts in Dockerfiles:**    
    
The fewer commands **that** create layers, **the** smaller your image **is** likely **to** be.    
    
**● Leverage build cache:**    
    
Docker will cache **the** results **of the first** build **of a** Dockerfile allowing subsequent builds to be super fast.    
    
**● Use .dockerignore:**    
    
Prevents sending unnecessary files to **the** daemon when building images.    
    
**● Use specific tags for production images:**    
    
Using specific versions **of** an image ensures **that** your application consistently works **as** expected.    
    
**● Always use the latest version of Docker:**    
    
Each new version **of** Docker includes security improvements, bug fixes, **and** new features.    
    
**18. Docker and Microservices:**    
    
**● Service discovery:**    
    
Docker Swarm Mode has a built-in DNS server that other containers can use **to** resolve the service name **to** an IP address.    
    
**● Service scaling:**    
    
**In** Docker Swarm Mode you can scale your services up **or** down. **● Load balancing:**    
    
Docker has a built-in load balancer that can distribute network connections **to** all instances of a replicated service.    
    
**● Secure communication between services:**    
    
Docker Swarm Mode has a built-in routing mesh that provides secure communication between services.    
    
**19. Docker Plugins:**    
    
**● Storage Plugins:**    
    
These plugins **provide** storage capabilities **to** Docker containers. **● Network Plugins:**    
    
These plugins **provide** networking capabilities **to** Docker containers. **● Authorization Plugins:**    
    
**20. Docker API:**    
    
**● Docker REST API:**    
    
An API used **by** applications to interact **with the** Docker daemon.    
    
**● Docker SDK:**    
    
SDKs **for** Go **and** Python, built **on** top **of the** Docker REST API.    
    
**● Docker Engine API:**    
    
The API Docker clients **use to** communicate **with** the Docker daemon.    
    
**21. Docker Editions:**    
    
**● Docker Community Edition (CE):**    
    
Ideal **for** individual developers **and** small teams looking **to get** started **with** Docker **and** experimenting **with** container-based apps.    
    
**● Docker Enterprise Edition (EE):**    
    
Designed **for** enterprise development **and** IT teams who build, ship, **and** run business-critical applications **in** production **at** scale.    
    
**22. Docker Architecture:**    
    
**● Docker Engine:**    
    
A client-server application with three major components: a server, a REST API, **and** a command-line interface (CLI).    
    
**● Docker Daemon:**    
    
Listens **for** Docker API requests **and** manages Docker objects **such as** images, containers, networks, **and** volumes.    
    
**● Docker Client:**    
    
The primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands **to** dockerd, which carries them out.    
    
**● Docker Images:**    
    
The basis **of** containers. An Image is **an** ordered collection **of** root filesystem changes **and the** corresponding execution parameters **for** use **within a** container runtime.    
    
**● Docker Containers:**    
    
A runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, **or** delete a container using the Docker API **or** CLI.    
    
**● Docker Services:**    
    
Allows you to scale containers across multiple Docker daemons, which all work together **as a** swarm **with** multiple managers **and** workers.
