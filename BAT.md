# Tips

@echo: This parameter will allow you to view your working script in the command prompt. This parameter is useful for viewing your working code. If any issues arise from the batch file, you will be able to view the issues associated with your script using the echo function. Adding a following off to this parameter will allow you to quickly close your script after it has finished.

- cls: Clears your command prompt, best used when extraneous code can make what you're accessing had to find.
- rem: Shorthand for remark provides the same functionality as <!-- tag in HTML. Rem statements are not entered into your code. Instead, they are used to explain and give information regarding the code.
- %%a: Each file in the folder.
- (".\"): The root folder. When using the command prompt, one must direct the prompt to a particular directory before changing a files name, deleting a file, and so on. With batch files, you only need to paste your BAT file into the directory of your choosing.
- pause: Allows a break in the logical chain of your BAT file. This allows for users to read over command lines before proceeding with the code. The phrase "Press any key to continue..." will denote a pause.
- start "" [website]: Will head to a website of your choice using your default web browser.
- ipconfig: This is a classic command prompt parameter that releases information concerning network information. This information includes MAC addresses, IP addresses, and sub-net masks.
- ping: Pings an IP address, sending data packets through server routes to gauge their location and latency (response time).
