# HTTP Request Methods

## Most Common

<table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><th>Method</th><th>Action</th></tr><tr><td><a href="/Article/HttpGet">GET</a></td><td>Retrieve information from the server. Should not modify the data on the server.
It can be cached, bookmarked,
and may remain in the browser history.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/Article/HttpHead">HEAD</a></td><td>Similar to GET, except it transfers the status line and headers only. Should not modify the data on the server.
It cannot be bookmarked
and does not remain in the browser history.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/Article/HttpPost">POST</a></td><td>Send data to the server, including images, JSON strings, file downloads, etc. It cannot be cached, bookmarked,
and not stored in the browser history.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/Article/HttpPut">PUT</a></td><td>Replace or update an existing resource on the server. May change server status.
It cannot be cached, bookmarked,
and not stored in browser history.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/Article/HttpPatch">PATCH</a></td><td>Partially modify the specified resource on the server. It is faster and requires less resources than the PUT method.
It cannot be cached, bookmarked,
and not stored in browser history.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/Article/HttpDelete">DELETE</a></td><td>Delete a resource from the server. May change server status.
It cannot be cached, bookmarked,
and not stored in browser history.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/Article/HttpOptions">OPTIONS</a></td><td>Used by browsers for CORS operations.
Describes the communication options available for the requested resource.
Does not change data on the server.
It cannot be cached, bookmarked,
and not stored in browser history.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/Article/HttpConnect">CONNECT</a></td><td>Establishes two-way communication with the server
by creating an HTTP tunnel through a proxy server.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/Article/HttpTrace">TRACE</a></td><td>It is designed for diagnostic purposes. When used, the web server sends back to the client the exact request that was received.</td></tr></tbody></table>

GET is the primary mechanism of information retrieval and the focus of almost all performance optimizations. Hence, when people speak of retrieving some identifiable information via HTTP, they are generally referring to making a GET request.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1                           | http://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF/RFC/7231                            | RFC 7231                                       |

The server SHOULD send the same header fields in response to a HEAD request as it would have sent if the request had been a GET, except that the payload header fields MAY be omitted. This method can be used for obtaining metadata about the selected representation without transferring the representation data and is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.                                                                                     | https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.2                           | http://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF/RFC/7231                            | RFC 7231                                       |

| PUT               | The PUT method requests that the state of the target resource be created or replaced with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request message payload. A successful PUT of a given representation would suggest that a subsequent GET on that same target resource will result in an equivalent representation being sent in a 200 (OK) response. However, there is no guarantee that such a state change will be observable, since the target resource might be acted upon by other user agents in parallel, or might be subject to dynamic processing by the origin server, before any subsequent GET is received. A successful response only implies that the user agent's intent was achieved at the time of its processing by the origin server. | https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.4                           | http://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF/RFC/7231                            | RFC 7231                                       |

Unlike the HTTP GET method, which requests that a server return a representation of the resource identified by the target URI, the QUERY method is used to ask the server to perform a query operation (described by the request payload) over some set of data scoped to the effective request URI. The payload returned in response to a QUERY cannot be assumed to be a representation of the resource identified by the effective request URI.                                                                                                                                | https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body#section-2 | http://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF/I-D/ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body | Internet Draft ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body |
