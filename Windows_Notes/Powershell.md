# Environment

> There are 3 scopes of what is called Environment Variables:
```[System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine```

```[System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User```

```[System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Process```

---

> To get list of variables, you can use

```[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables($scope)```

```
[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables() 
# This will mix all scopes in one output
```

---

> To set variable, you can use

```[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($varName, $varValue, $scope)```

---

> If $scope is Machine or User, it will try to store data, otherwise it will throw an exception.

---
---

- ```$Env:```

> is actually a virtual PowerShell drive and environment variables are items on it. There is a special provider Get-PSProvider -PSProvider Environment
> that implements this method of accessing to environment in powershell.

***

> You can run '''Get-ChildItem -Path 'Env:\''''
> and this is exactly the same as ```[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables()```
> without specifying scope.

$folders.ForEach({
	Add-Content -Path "$_\SampleFile.txt" -Value "This is the content of the file"
})
```

### Creating a File in Each Sub-Folder in a Directory using the ForEach Statement

```shell
# Define the TOP-level folder
$TOP_FOLDER = "C:\ARCHIVE_VOLUMES"

# Get all sub folders recursively
$Child_Folders = Get-ChildItem -Path $TOP_FOLDER -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.PSIsContainer -eq $true }

# Create a text file in each sub-folder and add the current date/time as value.
foreach ($foldername in $Child_Folders.FullName) {
   (get-date -Format G) | Out-File -FilePath "$($foldername)\BackupState.txt" -Force
}
```

> Using the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, you can confirm that the files were created or update inside each of the sub-folders.

```shell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path C:\ARCHIVE_VOLUMES -Include backupstate.txt | Select-Object Fullname,CreationTime,LastWriteTime,Length
```

### Reading the Contents of each Text File in Sub-Directories

```shell
## Find all BackupState.txt files in C:\ARCHIVE_VOLUMES
$files = Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path C:\ARCHIVE_VOLUMES -Include 'BackupState.txt' | Select-Object DirectoryName,FullName

## Read the contents of each file
foreach ($file in $files) {
    Write-Output ("$($file.DirectoryName) last backup time - " + (Get-Content $file.FullName))
}
```

### Getting Services and Starting Them using the ForEach-Object CmdLet

```shell
## Get a list of automatic services that are stopped.
$services = Get-Service | Where-Object {$.StartType -eq 'Automatic' -and $.Status -ne 'Running'}

## Pass each service object to the pipeline and process them with the Foreach-Object cmdlet
$services | ForEach-Object {
    try {
        Write-Host "Attempting to start '$($.DisplayName)'"
        Start-Service -Name $.Name -ErrorAction STOP
        Write-Host "SUCCESS: '$($.DisplayName)' has been started"
    } catch {
        Write-output "FAILED: $($.exception.message)"
    }
}
```

### Reading Data from CSV using the ForEach() Method

```shell
# Import list of Firstname and Lastname from CSV file
$newUsers = Import-Csv -Path .\Employees.csv

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Web

# Process the list
$newUsers.foreach(
    {
        # Generate a random password
        $password = [System.Web.Security.Membership]::GeneratePassword((Get-Random -Minimum 20 -Maximum 32), 3)
        $secPw = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $password -AsPlainText -Force

        # Formulate a username
        $userName = '{0}{1}' -f $_.FirstName.Substring(0, 1), $_.LastName

        # Build new user attributes
        $NewUserParameters = @{
            GivenName       = $_.FirstName
            Surname         = $_.LastName
            Name            = $userName
            AccountPassword = $secPw
        }

        try {
            New-AdUser @NewUserParameters -ErrorAction Stop
            Write-Output "User '$($userName)' has been created."
        }
        catch {
            Write-Output $_.Exception.Message
        }
    }
)
```

## Don't Sleep

```powershell
 param($minutes = 900)
 $myShell = New-Object -com "Wscript.Shell"
 $start = 0
 echo $start
 for ($i = 0; $i -lt $minutes; $i++) {
  $start += 1;
  echo $start;
  Start-Sleep -Seconds 30
   $myShell.sendkeys(" ")
 }
```

- or

```powershell
 Echo "Keep-alive with Scroll Lock..."
 $WShell = New-Object -com "Wscript.Shell"
 $start = 0
 while ($true)
 {
 $start += 1;
 echo $start;
   $WShell.sendkeys("{SCROLLLOCK}")
   Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 100
   $WShell.sendkeys("{SCROLLLOCK}")
   Start-Sleep -Seconds 100
 }
```

## answer prompt

```shell
 foreach($i in $files) {'y' | powershell -c "Remove-Item $i -Force -ErrorAction silentlycontinue"}
```

## parallel

```shell
powershell.exe Get-ChildItem C:\Users\$env:UserName\source\repos\GitHub\Veridian\Google\Default | ForEach-Object -Parallel {Remove-Item "$_" -Force -Recurse | Out-Null}
powershell.exe Get-ChildItem  "C:\Users\$env:UserName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default" | Where-Object Name -NotIn @( 'Cache','Code Cache','databases','Extension State','File System' , 'IndexedDB', 'WebStorage', 'Sessions', 'Service Worker', 'Web Applications', 'Default') | ForEach-Object -Parallel {Copy-Item "$_" -Destination C:\Users\$env:UserName\source\repos\GitHub\Veridian\Google\Default -Recurse -Force}
