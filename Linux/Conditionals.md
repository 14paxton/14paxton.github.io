# Check if File does Not Exist

> Similar to many other languages, the test expression can be negated using the ! (exclamation mark) logical not operator:

```bash
FILE=/etc/docker
if [ ! -f "$FILE" ]; then
    echo "$FILE does not exist."
fi
```

> Different syntax:

```bash
[ ! -f /etc/docker ] && echo "$FILE does not exist."
```

# Check if Multiple Files Exist #

> Instead of using complicated nested if/else constructs you can use -a (or && with [[) to test if multiple files exist:

```bash
if [ -f /etc/resolv.conf -a -f /etc/hosts ]; then
    echo "Both files exist."
fi
```

> differnt syntax

```bash
if [[ -f /etc/resolv.conf && -f /etc/hosts ]]; then
    echo "Both files exist."
fi
```

## File test operators

The test command includes the following FILE operators that allow you to test for particular types of files:

### True if the FILE exists and is a special block file.

```shell
 -b FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and is a special character file.

```shell
 -c FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and is a directory.

```shell
 -d FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and is a file, regardless of type (node, directory, socket, etc.).

```shell
 -e FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and is a regular file (not a directory or device).

```shell
 -f FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and has the same group as the user running the command.

```shell
 -G FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and is a symbolic link.

```shell
 -h FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and has set-group-id (sgid) flag set.

```shell
 -g FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and has a sticky bit flag set.

```shell
 -k FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and is a symbolic link.

```shell
 -L FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and is owned by the user running the command.

```shell
 -O FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and is a pipe.

```shell
 -p FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and is readable.

```shell
 -r FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and is a socket.

```shell
 -S FILE
 ```

### True if the FILE exists and has nonzero size.

```shell
 -s FILE 
 ```

### True if the FILE exists, and `set-user-id (suid)` flag is set.

```shell
 -u FILE 
```

### True if the FILE exists and is writable.

```shell
 -w FILE 
```

### True if the FILE exists and is executable.

```shell 
-x FILE
```
