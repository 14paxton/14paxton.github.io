# Projects

## Front End

### [React Hook Form - ReactHookFormFields/SelectBox.js](https://github.com/14paxton/ReactHookFormDynamicComponents)

- **What I did**:
    - Learned and created a proof of concept using a dynamic library to create forms with React Hook Forms, replacing Formik.
    - Found unconventional ways to make forms and components work as per end-user requests (e.g., submitting a form via a button in a modal produced
      by a parent component, using controlled Material UI fields in forms designed for uncontrolled fields).

### [Material Table - assessmentresultstable.js](https://github.com/14paxton/TableWithAsyncCall)

- **What I did**:
    - Created a custom search function component using React Hook Forms.
    - Developed an async search and load function that prevented the entire table from re-rendering.

- **Challenges**:
    - Displaying Material UI chips with assessment names under the table upon selection.
    - Implemented a custom "select all" function that only selects items on the current page, preserving selections across pages but resetting on
      further pagination.

### [Dynamic Ellipsis Component - ellipsismodifier.js](https://github.com/14paxton/DynamicEllipsis)

- **What it does**:
    - Adds an ellipsis based on text length or dynamically adds one when text overflows a div. Adjusts ellipsis on page resize.

### [Date Range Picker - presetdaterangepicker.js](https://github.com/14paxton/DateRangePicker)

- **What I did**:
    - Customized an existing React date range picker to work with the advanced search form I created.

- **Challenges**:
    - Found it difficult to match the designerâ€™s expectations, as their example used an old jQuery date picker.

### [Dynamic Tooltip](https://gist.github.com/14paxton/9c745874ec384add89c1908c73832594)

- **What it does**:
    - Displays a tooltip only when text is truncated due to the screen size.

### [HOC for PowerPoint Creation](https://github.com/14paxton/TableToPowerPoint)

- **What I did**:
    - Created a higher-order component to generate a PowerPoint presentation from a table using JavaScript and React.

### [Barcode Scanner for Web App Input](https://gist.github.com/14paxton/09adce350289bdcc1df92ed425c1d548)

- **What I did**:
    - Created a custom React TypeScript hook to listen for barcode input from a hand scanner.
- **Challenges**:
    - Differentiating between keyboard input and barcode scanner input.

## Backend

### [Pulling Images and PDFs from S3 Bucket for Email Attachment](https://gist.github.com/14paxton/1fa8f703b708b9488408c9217a83b3a9)

- **What I did**:
    - Retrieved images from an S3 bucket and attached them to an email sent using Postmark.
- **Challenges**:
    - Needed to access files while the authorization token was still valid, then send them to a JMS queue for email attachment processing.

### [Testing GORM and Hibernate Queries](https://www.cotdc.com/GrailsNotes/Testing#mocking-hibernate-used-to-test-methods-using-where-queriers--detached-criteria--criteria-builder)

- **What I did**:
    - Researched Hibernate and GORM documentation and came up with a method to mock Hibernate datastore and PlatformTransactionManager.

### [Configuring a Plugin to Create Multiple Domain Objects](https://www.cotdc.com/GrailsNotes/Testing#using-test-data-from-buildtest-plugin)

- **What I did**:
    - Configure a plugin to create multiple fully qualified domain objects simultaneously.

### Integration with Office 365 for Assessment Scheduling

- **What I did**:
    - Integrated scheduled assessments with both interviewers' and interviewees' Outlook calendars.

### [Async Service for Batch Role Changes](https://gist.github.com/14paxton/ef4f6e91fa7fa44015c41f26a1caf3ae)

- **What I did**:
    - Created an async service to process batch role changes for users.

- **Role Comparison Example**:
    - [Comparing role groups](https://gist.github.com/14paxton/b7ff93091f4db71beffb0a37140fa0f2)

### [Optimized Search Functionality](https://gist.github.com/14paxton/b5a8d600dc4066010b4067bd8968f613)

- **What I did**:
    - Limited database calls to optimize search functionality across multiple columns.

### [Elastic Search - Fuzzy Search Capability](https://gist.github.com/14paxton/3a352d2824bde0e97960409056f682cc)

- **What I did**:
    - Implemented fuzzy search capabilities using ElasticSearch.

### [Optimized SQL Queries Using HQL](https://gist.github.com/14paxton/e72c14086f5d9a6a0c58dc8463b93561)

- **What I did**:
    - Using HQL and Gorm I created abstract classes to search multiple columns for data, and bind the return to an object

### [Used Spring Tansactiona Status to create my own Rollback](https://gist.github.com/14paxton/a212d86552b05b95ef91ee444197fd4e)

- **What I did**:
  - Created a batch delete, for deleting a group associated with users
- **Challenges**:
  - Spring rollback was causing issues due to the nature of deleting, needed to manually trigger

### Using Micronaut to Create Microservices

- [With MySQL](https://github.com/14paxton/micronaut_mysql_hibernate)
- [With Microstream](https://github.com/14paxton/micronaut_microstream)

## Things I Enjoy

### Finding Quirky, Unorthodox Ways to Use a Language

- **Setting custom validity for a form field**:
    ```javascript
    e.target.setCustomValidity('invalid');
    ```

- **Programmatically setting HTML in a string for React**:
    ```javascript
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML
    ```

    ```jsx
    {__html: '<p>' + result?.themeSummary + '. <i>*Theme Of Significance.</i></p>'}
    <Tooltip title={<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={modifiedToolTip}/>} childrenDisplayStyle="inline">
    ```

- **Custom Enum Checks**:
    - Instead of using try/catch for key validation, created a utility:
    ```groovy
    AssessmentPurpose
        .getEnumConstants()
        .find { it.key.equalsIgnoreCase("extrn") }?.value
    ```

- **Get Enum by Value**:
    ```groovy
    FitStatement.getEnumConstants()
        .find { (it.value == member.result) }?.match ?: member.result
    ```

- **Pad a string to a certain length with spaces in Java**:
    ```java
      String padded=String.format("%-20s",str);
    ```
